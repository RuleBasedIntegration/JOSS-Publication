# JOSS-Publication of Rubi

To make Rubi citable in scientific works, we should aim to publish it officially in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). This will provide a DOI and a clear way to cite it in research papers which will both help the users to have a consistent way of citing and it will increase the visibility of Rubi.

For JOSS, we only need a concise summary and references. A published example [paper in markdown is here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrn/gala/f6bb2532afeed3c0b0feea3037bf71a3f42b2a12/paper/paper.md). The Author guidelines are [here](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html).

This repository contains `paper.md` which is the written paper and `paper.bib` which contains the bibliographic references in bibtex format.
